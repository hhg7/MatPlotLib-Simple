Newlines are now possible in key names for barplot and pie; other characters may be fixed too
@prop_cycle is only now taking RAM/valid where it's needed
new dependencies in JSON::MaybeXS and MIME::Base64 to prevent errors in key names
slight improvement in violinplot: "print" changed to "say" (1 less concatenation)
dynamic method wrappers are used, which save ~120 lines of code
re-used error array in "plt" to save RAM
better warning for non-File::Temp objects
more tests for wrapper subroutines
duplicate check removed from hexbin_helper
removed whiskers option from boxplot_helper, which didn't work the way that I thought that it did
removed shebang, which isn't necessary in .pm files
hist2d was missing an option for logscale on the axes, which it now has

colors for bar plots can be defined by hashes; e.g. colors => {A => 'red', B => 'green'}, etc

minor under-the-hood changes; "execute" subroutine, which was only called once, is now built into "plt" to save a function call; execution should be slightly faster/more efficient

"show" now works; files are still output if specified

better warnings for incomplete data in "plot"
"plot" can plot with "twinx" when data is given in array or hash form
"tick_params" is removed from plt methods
fewer "my" for error arrays, using empty arrays from earlier; should increase efficiency slightly
added tests for twinx in plot for both array and hash variants
