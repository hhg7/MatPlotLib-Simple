minor under-the-hood changes; "execute" subroutine, which was only called once, is now built into "plt" to save a function call; execution should be slightly faster/more efficient

better warnings for incomplete data in "plot"
"plot" can plot with "twinx" when data is given in array or hash form
"tick_params" is removed from plt methods
fewer "my" for error arrays, using empty arrays from earlier; should increase efficiency slightly
added tests for twinx in plot for both array and hash variants
