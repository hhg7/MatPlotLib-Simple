Newlines are now possible in key names for barplot and pie; other characters may be fixed too
@prop_cycle is only now taking RAM/valid where it's needed
new dependencies in JSON::MaybeXS and MIME::Base64 to prevent errors in key names
slight improvement in violinplot: "print" changed to "say" (1 less concatenation)
dynamic method wrappers are used, which save ~120 lines of code
re-used error array in "plt"
better warning for non-File::Temp objects

colors for bar plots can be defined by hashes; e.g. colors => {A => 'red', B => 'green'}, etc

minor under-the-hood changes; "execute" subroutine, which was only called once, is now built into "plt" to save a function call; execution should be slightly faster/more efficient

"show" now works; files are still output if specified

better warnings for incomplete data in "plot"
"plot" can plot with "twinx" when data is given in array or hash form
"tick_params" is removed from plt methods
fewer "my" for error arrays, using empty arrays from earlier; should increase efficiency slightly
added tests for twinx in plot for both array and hash variants
