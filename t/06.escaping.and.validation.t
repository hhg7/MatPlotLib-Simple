# Text that is data, and data that is wrong.
#
# Two classes of bug, both fixed in 0.3132, both invisible to the other test
# files because every one of them plots keys named "A" and "B".
#
# 1. Anything the caller names -- a data key, a tick label, a member of a venn
#    set -- is written into the generated python as text.  It used to be
#    written into a double-quoted literal by hand, '["' . join('","', @keys)
#    . '"]', which a key holding a double quote turns into a SyntaxError and a
#    key holding a backslash turns into something worse: python reads the "\a"
#    of '$\alpha$' as a bell character, so the label is silently wrong and the
#    script still parses.  py_str/py_list now escape all of it.
#
# 2. Data that cannot be drawn used to reach matplotlib, or reach perl's own
#    runtime, rather than being refused here: a non-numeric bar height became
#    the bare python name "abc", a "key.order" naming a key that "data" does
#    not have died as "Use of uninitialized value in join or string", and a
#    logscale of "xy" emitted ax.set_xyscale("log").  Every one of these now
#    dies naming the key, the option and the plot type.
#
# The python parser gate is the same as t/05.generated.python.t's and is
# skipped the same way when python3 is absent; everything else here is
# execute => 0 and runs everywhere, which is the part a Windows smoker sees.
